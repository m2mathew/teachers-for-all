### About Teachers For All

In the Austin, Texas area, César De León worked as a fine arts teacher, campus administrator, and later the fine arts supervisor for the Austin Independent School District. Many fine arts students would like to attend summer camps, but many students are unable to afford the cost of the camps. He founded **Teachers For All** to help connect students with scholarships for fine arts camps.
