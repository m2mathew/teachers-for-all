### About Teachers For All

In the Austin, Texas area, César De León worked as a fine arts teacher, campus administrator, and later the fine arts supervisor for the Austin Independent School District where he continues to serve over 65,000 fine arts students each day. He founded the **Teachers For All** organization to help students in the Austin, Texas area. César is a highly engaging and creative professional with a passion for learning and improving social justice.

Many fine arts students would like to attend summer camps, but some students are unable to afford the cost of the camps. César founded **Teachers For All** to help connect students with scholarships for fine arts camps. Funds for scholarhips are raised through donations and fundraising events.

Get in touch with us to learn more about our work and how you can get involved with changing the lives of fine arts students in the Austin, Texas area through **Teachers For All**!
