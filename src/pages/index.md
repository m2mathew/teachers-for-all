### It's all about the kids

**Teachers For All** exists to help connect fine arts students in the Austin, Texas area with scholarship opportunities for fine arts camps.

Many fine arts students would like to attend summer camps, but some students are unable to afford the cost of the camps. **Teachers For All**, founded by Austin ISD Fine Arts Supervisor César De León, helps connect students with scholarships for fine arts camps. Funds for scholarhips are raised through donations and fundraising events.
